I promise to never use my private key associated with real money in plain text.

For the moment , a `$PRIVATE_KEY` in my `.env` is cool, as long as i don't expose my `.env` file!
But for real money, I won't do that. I will use `--interactive` or a keystore file with a password when foundry adds that.
